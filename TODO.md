# BeQ MVP Development Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan to complete the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the BeQ life management application. The project features a Next.js frontend, FastAPI microservices backend, AI integration with OpenRouter, and Supabase database.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, chat interface, schedule view components
- **Backend**: FastAPI microservices (orchestrator, scheduler, RAG recommender, calendar integration)
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter with Gemma 3 27B IT model
- **Database**: Supabase setup
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, monitoring, and deployment configs
