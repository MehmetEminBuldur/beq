# 🧠 100% Open Source LLM-Based Scheduling with Gemma 3 27B IT

BeQ uses advanced AI-powered scheduling with Google's **open source** Gemma 3 27B IT model via OpenRouter to create optimal, human-like schedules. **No closed-source models are used.**

## 🎯 Overview

Traditional scheduling algorithms use rigid mathematical optimization. BeQ's LLM-based approach combines:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Understands context and nuanced preferences
- **Human-like Reasoning**: Makes scheduling decisions like a personal assistant
- **Adaptive Learning**: Learns from user feedback and patterns
- **Context Awareness**: Considers work-life balance, energy levels, and preferences

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### OpenRouter Integration

```python
# OpenRouter client configuration
client = OpenRouterClient()
model = "google/gemma-2-27b-it"
provider = "OpenRouter"
```

### Scheduling Process

1. **Context Collection**: Gather user preferences, existing events, constraints
2. **LLM Prompt Generation**: Create detailed scheduling prompt
3. **AI Reasoning**: Gemma 3 27B IT analyzes and generates optimal schedule
4. **Result Parsing**: Extract structured schedule from LLM response
5. **Validation & Fallback**: Validate results or use fallback algorithm

## 🧩 Scheduling Context

The LLM receives comprehensive context:

```python
@dataclass
class SchedulingContext:
    user_preferences: Dict[str, Any]      # Work hours, energy patterns
    existing_events: List[Dict[str, Any]] # Fixed calendar events
    tasks_to_schedule: List[Dict[str, Any]] # Tasks needing scheduling
    constraints: List[Dict[str, Any]]     # Hard/soft constraints
    current_time: datetime                # Current timestamp
    planning_horizon_days: int = 7        # Days to plan ahead
```

## 🎨 Intelligent Scheduling Features

### 1. Energy-Based Optimization
- **High-Energy Tasks**: Scheduled during peak hours (typically mornings)
- **Routine Tasks**: Placed during low-energy periods
- **Creative Work**: Aligned with user's creative peak times

### 2. Context Switching Minimization
- **Task Batching**: Groups similar tasks together
- **Transition Time**: Includes buffers between different task types
- **Focus Blocks**: Creates uninterrupted work periods

### 3. Work-Life Balance
- **Boundary Respect**: Maintains clear work/personal boundaries
- **Break Scheduling**: Ensures adequate breaks every 90-120 minutes
- **Commute Consideration**: Accounts for travel time

### 4. Adaptive Preferences
- **Learning from Feedback**: Adjusts based on user behavior
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Adapts to changing routines
- **Stress Management**: Avoids over-scheduling during busy periods

## 📝 Example LLM Prompt

```

    "deadline": "2024-01-18 17:00:00",
    "requires_deep_focus": true
  }
]

Create an optimal schedule considering energy levels, 
work-life balance, and productivity optimization...
```

## 🎯 LLM Response Format

```json
{
  "scheduled_events": [
    {
      "task_id": "task_1",
      "title": "Quarterly Report - Deep Work Session",
      "start_time": "2024-01-15 09:00:00",

      "notes": "Scheduled during peak energy hours for optimal productivity"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Scheduled the high-priority quarterly report during your peak energy hours (9-11 AM) with an extended focus block...",
  "confidence_score": 0.92,
  "alternative_suggestions": [
    "Consider splitting into two 90-minute sessions if one block feels too long",
    "Schedule a brief review session the day before the deadline"
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "This creates a 3-hour focus block - ensure you have adequate breaks"
  ]
}
```

## 🔄 Fallback Mechanisms

If LLM scheduling fails, BeQ uses intelligent fallbacks:

1. **Simple Heuristic**: Time-based sequential scheduling
2. **Priority-Based**: High-priority tasks in available slots
3. **User Notification**: Informs user of fallback usage
