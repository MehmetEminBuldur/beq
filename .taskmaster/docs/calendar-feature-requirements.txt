CALENDAR AND SCHEDULING PAGE - DETAILED REQUIREMENTS

This document outlines the requirements for creating a production-quality, professional-looking calendar and scheduling page with advanced features.

## 1. MULTIPLE VIEWS
The calendar must support three distinct view modes:

### Daily View
- Display a single day's schedule with hour-by-hour breakdown
- Show time slots from early morning to late evening
- Highlight current time with a moving indicator
- Support scrolling to navigate through hours
- Show events/tasks in chronological order

### Weekly View  
- Display 7-day week view with days as columns
- Show time slots as rows with hourly granularity
- Support week navigation (previous/next week)
- Display week of year and date range
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Monthly View
- Traditional calendar grid with dates
- Show events as small blocks or dots on dates
- Support month navigation
- Highlight today's date
- Show month/year in header

## 2. INTERACTIVE SCHEDULING (MANUAL)
Implement drag-and-drop functionality for schedule management:

### Schedule Objects (Bricks/Quantas)
- Visual blocks representing tasks, events, or time blocks
- Different colors/styles for different types:
  - Bricks: Larger projects/goals (darker colors)
  - Quantas: Smaller tasks/actions (lighter colors)
  - Events: External calendar events (distinct styling)

### Drag-and-Drop Functionality
- Drag schedule objects from sidebar/palette onto calendar
- Drag existing objects to new time slots
- Visual feedback during drag (ghost image, drop zones)
- Snap to time grid (15-30 minute increments)
- Conflict detection and resolution

### Resizing Capability
- Resize objects by dragging top/bottom edges
- Visual resize handles on hover
- Minimum duration constraints (15-30 minutes)
- Maximum duration validation
- Real-time duration display during resize

## 3. AI OPTIMIZATION (AUTOMATED)
Integrate AI-powered scheduling optimization:

### AI Adjustment Controls
- "Optimize" button/context menu for selected objects
- Batch optimization for multiple objects
- Optimization criteria selection:
  - Minimize conflicts
  - Maximize focus time
  - Balance workload
  - Consider energy levels
  - Account for deadlines

### Optimization Engine Integration
- Connect to existing scheduler service
- Send optimization requests with constraints
- Apply AI suggestions with user confirmation
- Show before/after comparison
- Allow undo/redo of optimizations

## 4. EMBEDDED CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACE
In-page chat for advanced scheduling actions:

### Chat Toggle Button
- Small, unobtrusive button (bottom-right corner)
- Icon indicating chat availability
- Badge for new suggestions/notifications
- Smooth animation for open/close

### Chat Window Implementation
- Overlay or slide-out sidebar design
- Resizable and draggable
- Message history persistence
- Typing indicators
- Context awareness of current calendar view

### Advanced Chat Commands
- "Find 2 hours next week for Project Alpha"
- "Reschedule all morning meetings to afternoon"
- "Block focus time for deep work"
- "Optimize my schedule for tomorrow"
- "What's my availability on Friday?"

## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Frontend Components
- Calendar grid component with time slots
- Draggable schedule object components
- View switcher (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Chat interface component
- Optimization controls

### Backend Integration
- Calendar events API (existing)
- Bricks/Quantas management API (existing)
- Schedule optimization service (existing)
- Chat/AI conversation API (existing)

### State Management
- Calendar view state (current date, view mode)
- Schedule objects state (bricks, quantas, events)
- Drag-and-drop state
- Chat conversation state
- Optimization requests state

### Real-time Updates
- Live updates from external calendars
- Real-time collaboration (future)
- Push notifications for changes
- Conflict resolution updates

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Responsive breakpoints
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

### Performance Considerations
- Virtual scrolling for large time ranges
- Lazy loading of events outside view
- Debounced API calls during interactions
- Local caching of frequently accessed data
